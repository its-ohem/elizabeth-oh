<h1>A Life on A Shelf: Lesbian Literacy and Lifespan Writing</h1>

<p>This project documents the experiences of Jill Lydia Ellis, a Cincinnati lesbian, who wrote 25 journals from 1973-2007.
With the help of three colleagues, we discovered Jill’s journals after they were donated posthumously at the Ohio Lesbian Archives. Jill’s writing is stark, personal, and arresting, and we saw a perfect opportunity for an archival exploration of her lifespan writing. Jill uses personal writing to explore her identity as a writer and a lesbian, and to work through relationships, emotions, desires, and dreams. There are stark differences in her journals over time, like changes to content, handwriting, size of text, and the level of formality. As we continue to read—as this project is an ongoing endeavor—we hope to track the changes and continuities in Jill’s writing across these three decades of personal writing practice.</p>
<p>On February 28, I presented our findings at the University of Cincinnati's Graduate Student Conference: Queered Methods, Queered Stories. We will continue to investigate the themes in Jill's journals.</p>
